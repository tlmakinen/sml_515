Review the code and recognize how the theoretical concepts of the Kernel Interaction Trick and the specific features of SKIM have been implemented. Then copy the code to this notebook and modify it so that you can execute the provided test example inline. Confirm that you get a result comparable to theirs.\n",

It also reports the posterior for all $\\theta$ (active and inactive ones), and only for one sample at a time. That's really clunky. Modify this function to produce flat posteriors samples from the MCMC (with an arbitrary length of samples) but only for the active direct and pairwise interaction terms. Visualize the posterior from the example with `corner`."

One surprising fact is that the mortality rate (i.e. the fraction of the infected who have died, also called **case-fatality ratio**) differs *a lot* between countries, from 15% to less than 1%. Find out which features (such as age distribution, population health indices, economic factors, COVID-specific factors ...) influences that rate.\n",

    "**1** Based on Griffin and Brown (2017), hierarchical priors in Bayesian regression are dependent on the size of the coefficients, where the hyperparameters control for shrinkage of coefficients similar to a penalty term. In particular, a small estimated variance in coefficients would enforce some shrinkage and likely yield a sparser model. The Gaussian scale mixture is in fact just a special case of hierarchical priors, in which $\\tau$ and $\\Sigma_\\tau$ control the shrinkage of $\\theta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2** This result is possible due to the Proposition 4.1 in Agrawal et al (2019). The function $\\Phi_2$ is designed such that it can be rewritten as a GP, namely the GP $g = \\theta^T\\Phi_2$. Then, the equivalence is completed by using the covariance $k_\\tau(x^{(i)},x^{(j})=\\Phi_2(x^{(i)})\\Sigma_\\tau\\Phi_2(x^{(j)})$ for $g\\sim GP(0,k_\\tau)$. Based on the weight-space view of GP from Rasmussen and Williams (2006), for any draw $g|\\tau\\sim N(0,k_\\tau)$, there exists a parameter vector $\\theta$ such that $g=\\theta^T\\Phi_2$. This completes the re-parametrization from Equation (3) to (6). \n",
    "\n",
    "**3** In the discussion of Priors for Related Predictors in Chipman (1996), one practical instance in which the strong hierarchy property would fail is in atmospheric sciences. A key relation is $log(Y)=log(A)+BC$, in which the interaction term $BC$ would not satisfy strong hierarchy, and thus could not be properly modeled using this approach. One conceptual limitation of the approach is the use of pairwise interactions. On one hand, the dimension of the parameter space is increased from $p$ to $\\frac{p(p+1)}{2}$, which could be extremely computationally expensive when $p$ is not even that large; on the other hand, there may be instances that involve higher-order polynomial interactions, and thus this model of at-most pairwise interactions could be too limited in its scope. In addition, the runtime is cubic and memory is quadraic with respect to the sample size $N$, which is as good or worse than other sampling methods it is compared to (NAIVE, WOODBURY, and FULL)"

Review the code and recognize how the theoretical concepts of the Kernel Interaction Trick and the specific features of SKIM have been implemented. Then copy the code to this notebook and modify it so that you can execute the provided test example inline. Confirm that you get a result comparable to theirs.\n",

    "The last step of their example analysis (sampling from the posterior with the method `sample_theta_space`) often returns `nan`s. It also reports the posterior for all $\\theta$ (active and inactive ones), and only for one sample at a time. That's really clunky. Modify this function to produce flat posteriors samples from the MCMC (with an arbitrary length of samples) but only for the active direct and pairwise interaction terms.

One surprising fact is that the mortality rate (i.e. the fraction of the infected who have died, also called **case-fatality ratio**) differs *a lot* between countries, from 15% to less than 1%. Find out which features (such as age distribution, population health indices, economic factors, COVID-specific factors ...) influences that rate.\n",
